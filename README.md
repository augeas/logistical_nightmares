Dark Ambient Sonic Abuse of the Logistic Map

The [bifurcation diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_diagram) of the [Logistic Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map) as
[popularised by Robert May](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237005499_Simple_Mathematical_Models_With_Very_Complicated_Dynamics) somewhat
lacks variety compared to some [other chaotic maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chaotic_maps).

If we take the recurrance relation

$$\Large{x_{n+1}=rx_{n}}(1-x_{n})$$

we can replace the single coefficient $r$ varied across the horizontal access with some repeating sequence of two coefficients $A$ and $B$.
For example, the sequence $ABAABBB$, where $A$ and $B$ are described by the points on a circle of radius 0.25 centred on (3.28, 3.28) looks
like:
